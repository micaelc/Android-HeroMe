# Android-HeroMe
###Based on the lessons of Udemy Course
###Android N: From Beginner to Paid Professional - Hero Me

Android Exercise - Finishing HeroMe
You are going to finish HeroMe.

#####Requirements
1. Finish the Pick Your Power screen 
 - Add UI
 - When you select an option the Show Backstory button should become enabled and allow the user to open the character bio screen
2. Create the Character Bio Screen 
 - Use a Fragment for this
 - Show a unique backstory description that includes the way the hero received their powers and what their Primary power is
 - Show the selected Primary Power and a Secondary Power. The primary power comes from how they received their powers and the secondary power is the one that was selected on the previous screen

#####Advanced (not done)
Draw the lines that we did not implement on the screen - the ones that go around the titles/etc and have the circles at the end.
You will need to do this using Canvas and coordinate point systems where you lay out the lines based on the other UI so it scales on all screen sizes. You do NOT want to use images for this.
